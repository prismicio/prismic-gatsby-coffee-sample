  Integrating Prismic data sources in Gatsby
</h1>

Example website demo that shows how to use the new Gatsby plugin for Prismic. You will require to have GraphQL enabled in your repository if you wish to use it _once it's widely available_.

It showcases how a website for a coffee store could be designed and built, as well as the techniques you will have to use to generate pages dynamically when using a Prismic repository as a data source, while also being able to use the **preview** and **release** features.

Based on the gatsby default starter and uses the [gatsby-source-prismic-graphql](https://github.com/birkir/gatsby-source-prismic-graphql) plugin for creating pages that can be drafted and previewed. Refer to its documentation for more details on how to use it.
